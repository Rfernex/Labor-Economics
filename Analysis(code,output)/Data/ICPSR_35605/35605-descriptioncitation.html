		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> The United States Census Bureau has conducted surveys of manufacturing activity since 1810 with fluctuating frequency. Between 1919 and 1939 the Census of Manufactures (CM) was conducted biennially. This data collection consists of individual-plant data from the Census of Manufactures for 1929, 1931, 1933, and 1935, the only years in this span for which original returns are available. The records of the Cotton Goods Industry have been coded to produce an electronic dataset to provide the basis for microeconomic evidence for the study of the Great Depression. The dataset contains observations on: basic information about the plants (e.g. name, location, owner, etc.), products made and materials used, operation and working hours, employment, wages and salaries, costs and amount of materials used, value of products and processing tax (1933 and 1935), machinery, and power used.</span></p>

								<div><strong>Data Collection Notes:</strong> <p>In the 1929 "Census of Manufactures," 10 plants either did not respond or had census notations in the margins indicating that the figures were incorrect. Because of budgetary restrictions for census edits, there is the potential for more uncaught errors in the man-hours data. (For 1929, the census did not publish aggregate man-hours statistics.), This collection is an edited version the Textile Industry data from ICPSR Study #31761: Census of Manufactures, Motor Vehicle and Textile Industry Plants, 1929, 1931, 1933, 1935 [United States]. Changes include editing erroneous and missing information as well as reorganizing the data into industry specific datasets., <p>For related information regarding the Census of Manufactures, please visit the United States Census Bureau's <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/asm.html"> Annual Survey of Manufactures</a> Web site and the United States Census Bureau's <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/economic-census.html"> Economic Census</a> Web site.</p>, Some of the variables from this dataset may be included in ICPSR 37114 - United States Census of Manufactures, 1929-1935.</p></div>
