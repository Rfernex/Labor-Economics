# Labor-Economics
Resources for the Replication Study I wrote within the scope of my M2 Labor Economics course. It includes : 
- The original replication package provided by the authors (in the folder Source_Code) as well as publicly available data required to run the scripts
- The code I wrote to perform the robustness checks described in my study (Replication_Code)
- The replication study paper I wrote
